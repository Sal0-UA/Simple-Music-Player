# Simple-Music-Player

Just a simple music player. It will play music, pause music, skip or replay 3 seconds. You can also create Lists of tracks
and they will play one after one. You will be able to add tracks to the list, remove them, clear it and maybe load whole list
from JSON files.

I used wxFormBuilder to create window.
Its very easy to use, because you don't have to write code. Just place blocks in their places.

Program is written on Python. I use it because it's easy to use it for me.
